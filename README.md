# VRmissilecontrol

Another VR idea I've been toying with-my school's hackerspace recently got an HTC Vive, so I was messing around with Space Pirate Trainer. This project will somehow incorporate elements of both SPT and an old favorite of mine - the [missile game](https://missile-game.bwhmather.com/).

Controls:
For now, probably mouse+keyboard. Given my current resources, I probably won't be getting in touch with an Oculus CV1 anytime soon, so touch controllers are likely not going to be implemented anytime soon.

We'll see.
